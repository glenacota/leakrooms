/* ============================================================
   THE PAUSE TICKET — SETTINGS AND BRIEFING ARE PAGES OF IT
   Every control writes straight into SETTINGS, then calls applySettings() and
   saveSettings(). There is no "apply" button and no pending copy: a slider
   that only commits on OK makes people wonder whether it saved, and these
   values are all cheap and reversible.

   They are not a screen of their own any more. They are the lower half of the
   ticket the player is already looking at, because a pause is the one moment
   the player has stopped to read a document — and a modal over that document
   hides the very thing the player paused to check. pausePage is the only state
   this adds: which page of the ticket is showing. STATE never leaves 'pause',
   so the clock stays frozen and the game behind the ticket stays stopped the
   way it always did, with no second state machine to keep in step.
   ============================================================ */

   reprint cannot start a run: the "any key advances" branch on the splash
   chain would fire behind the player's back otherwise, and a second copy of
   one hundred words is a cheaper thing to own than a second way to lose a
